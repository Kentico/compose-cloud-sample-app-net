## Application setup

We recommend running the sample application in Visual Studio 2013 or later. By default, the application uses the default Kentico Cloud Sample project to serve content.

To run the aplication:

1. Clone the sample application repository.
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio (using the _DancingGoat.sln_ file).
1. Run the application.

The sample application will open in your browser.

## Connect your project

If you already have a Kentico Cloud account, you can connect this sample application to a project of your own. You will propably want to connect it to your Kentico Compose Demo project.

1. Select your project in Kentico Cloud.
1. Navigate to the **API keys** section.

    * You will be copying the Project ID and API keys for the Delivery Preview API and Personalization API.

1. Open the `\DancingGoat\Web.config` file.
1. Use the values from your Kentico Cloud project in the `Web.config` file:

    * **Project ID**: Insert your project ID into the `ProjectId` application setting.
    * **Delivery Preview API**: Create a new application setting named `PreviewToken` in the `<appSettings>` section, and use the Delivery Preview API key as its value.

    ```xml
    <appSettings>
        ...
        <add key="ProjectId" value="YOUR_PROJECT_ID" />
        <add key="PreviewToken" value="YOUR_DELIVERY_PREVIEW_API_KEY" />
        ...
    </appSettings>
    ```

1. Save the changes.
1. Run the application.

After you run the application, you will be able to see all project content including the unpublished version of content items.
